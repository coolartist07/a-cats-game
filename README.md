My entry for the Brainless Mini-Game Jam!

A Cat's Game: Enjoy a paws from your hectic schedule by playing a classic game of tic-tac-toe, but with cats!

Description: Heyo! Since I'm on winter break, I decided to work on my game dev skills more by participating in my first game jam! I decided to join the Brainless Mini-Game Jam because:
1.) This guy was keeping me motivated during the development of my visual novel
2.) It was happening the week while I was still on winter break

I really went off the deep end by using an engine I've never used before (Godot) for my first (solo) game jam. I kept scope simple, following a tic-tac-toe tutorial by Coding With Russ on YouTube. I made it my own by drawing (and animating!) my own assets along with creating a bot opponent, main menu, and loading screen. Still one of my finest moments having a working bot program at 4am because I had to reverse-engineer that thing all on my own.

Original idea for this game was to have a shop system. Every time you won a tic-tac-toe game, you would earn the coins you were using to play. From there, you could go to the lucky cat shop to buy new game modes and skins for different assets. Some ideas I had for the game modes included:
- a 4x4 game board (to play Connect 4)
- hard mode (with an actually smart bot)
- double income perk (every time you win a game, you get twice the money)
- traps (for example, if you predict where your opponent will go next, they lose their turn [might only have to work once tho])
- asset skins
- and a secret achievement where if you get 9 cats games (like 9 lives), you get the lucky cat asset bundle!

Maybe I'll come back to add these things in the future when I'm more skilled, maybe not lol. Though I couldn't add everything, I learned a lot from being in this game jam and submitting something!

Things I learned:
- Godot's node system/hierarchy
- Lil bit of animation
- Using Github's push/pull and branching
- GDScript basics and event functions
- Logic behind 2D arrays and game viewports
- Engineering a bot opponent
- Importing sound effects
- Designing GUI/texture buttons
- Drawing and importing assets
- Making a main menu, game over menu, and loading screen
- Making a functional game halfway through the jam, then polishing
- Exporting a game as an html file (kinda)
- Give yourself at least 2 hours to export a game (I went way too close to deadline)

Overall, I really had fun with this game jam! I'm proud of myself for actually making something like this on time and hope to participate in more in the future :DD
